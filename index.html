        Roots & The Discriminant
      </legend>

      <p>
        To find the Discriminant(D), you need to use the values of a, b, and c. The formula to find the Discriminant
        is:<br> D = b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac
      </p>

      <p>
        Substituting in the values of a, b, and c:
      </p>

      <p id="discriminant"></p>

      <p>
        We can use this information to find out how many real roots(solutions) the equation has.
      </p>

      <p>
        If D > 0, 2 real roots;<br>
        If D = 0, 1 real root;<br>
        If D < 0, 0 real roots;<br><br>
          So, based on the Discriminant value we have,
      </p>

      <p id="findRealRoots"></p>
      <p>(If the values of the roots shown below are the same, then the amount of roots above should say 1.)</p>
